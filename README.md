### Overview & Business Problem

Consumers today have thousands of movies available to them for viewing at any given moment om many different streaming platforms. While access to so much content is what drives many users to have subscriptions to multiple platforms, the sheer volumne can be overwhelming at the same time. 

The massive movie catalogs leave consumers grappling with the challenge of choice as they start their scrolling journey. While the vast selection caters to diverse tastes, the experience of navigating through countless titles can be time consuming and overwhelming. The more time users spend sifting through choices, the higher the likelihood of encountering decision fatigue, frustration, and, ultimately, moving away from using the platform. 

StreamYou is seeking to address this issue as they've observed increased scrolling time on their platform reducing their conversion rates (when users select and watch a movie). For the context of this project, I am a data scientist working on optimizing the recommendation engine at StreamYou to address the following concerns: 

<b> 1. Reduced Satisfaction: </b> Users struggle to find relevant movies, leading to decreased satisfaction with the platform.

<b> 2. Lower Conversion Rates: </b> Lengthy scrolling sessions resulting in users leaving the platform before making a selection, impacting conversion rates.

<b> 3. Lack of Genre Specific Recommendations: </b> Users don't currently have a way to express a genre preference to explicitly choose and receive recommendations based on their preferred movie genre.
